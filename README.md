# Unemployment-Analysis

Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate which is the number of people who are unemployed as a percentage of the total labour force. We have seen a sharp increase in the unemployment rate during Covid-19, so analyzing the unemployment rate can be a good data scienceÂ project. In this Jupyter Notebook, I have analyzed the rate of unemployment in India in the year 2020, with the help of Python and Data Visualization Libraries like Maplotlib, Seaborn and Plotly.
